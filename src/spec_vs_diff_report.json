  "summary": "App.tsx was updated to gate initial rendering behind FirstLaunchPreloader using in-memory React state (defaulting to showing the preloader on each full app load). This should prevent the preloader from re-triggering on internal SPA route changes. However, the diff does not provide direct evidence that the prior localStorage-based first-launch behavior (key: 'app-first-launch-complete') was removed/neutralized inside FirstLaunchPreloader (or elsewhere), so REQ-3 cannot be confirmed from the provided changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Remove or replace the current persistent 'first launch only' localStorage behavior (key: 'app-first-launch-complete') so it no longer prevents the preloader from showing on subsequent app opens.",
      "reason": "The diff shows App.tsx no longer reads localStorage, but it does not include any changes to FirstLaunchPreloader (or other code) to prove the 'app-first-launch-complete' key is no longer read/used to skip the preloader. Without seeing that code removed/updated, it is not verifiable that previously-set localStorage will not suppress the preloader.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (no localStorage logic shown; FirstLaunchPreloader unchanged/not shown)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions 'no localStorage persistence' but provides no code-level evidence of removing 'app-first-launch-complete' usage)"
